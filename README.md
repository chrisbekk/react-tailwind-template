# React / TailwindCSS Template

## Description

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working with TailwindCSS, based on Vite's template structure.

## Setup

### 1 Clone Remote Repository

Create a local project folder and `cd` into it.

Run the following command in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/chrisbekk/react-tailwind-template.git .`

This will clone the remote repo into your project folder.

#### In order to set up your own remote git repo, you must first change the origin URL before pushing local changes.

Create a new empty repository on github, copy the URL and run the following command in your terminal:

`git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REMOTE-REPO.git`

#### Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file.

### 2 Initialize Project

Run `npm i` in order to install the dependencies. You are now ready to use the template, and can run `npm run dev`.

Happy coding.
